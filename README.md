My name is Alexandra Yen and I'm currently a second year student studying nutritional science. Since the classes I take for my major don't deal with coding, this will be a dauntingm yet informative experience for me. Some things I like to do include cooking and growing plants. I'm always looking for ways to propogate new herbs and different house plants.
